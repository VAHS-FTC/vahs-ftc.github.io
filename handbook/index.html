<h1 id="team-handbook">Team Handbook</h1>
<p><strong>VAHS <em>FIRST</em> Tech Challenge Teams:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Cat Robotics #20679</li>
<li>Gear Hounds #22265</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong><em>FIRST</em> (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)</strong></p>
<p><em>FIRST</em> Tech Challenge (FTC) is a unique sport of the mind, designed to help
middle- and high school aged people discover how interesting and rewarding the
life of engineers and researchers can be. FTC challenges teams of young people
to solve a robotics challenge in a game competition format. Starting with a
"kit of parts" and a common set of rules, teams build robots and enter them in
competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, a committee of
engineers and other professionals. Teams are challenged to design, build,
program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an
alliance format.</p>
<p>Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice
engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and
working as a team.</p>
<p><em>FIRST</em> redefines winning for these students because they are rewarded for
excellence in design, demonstrated team spirit, gracious professionalism,
maturity, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Scoring the most points is a
secondary goal. Winning means building partnerships that last.</p>
<p>We are proud of our ability to work as a team. Each team member should strive
to apply this philosophy to his/her every action as a Tech Cat or a Gear Hound.
The winners of <em>FIRST</em> competitions are teams, not individuals. Being a team
means not fighting over who is right or wrong. Discussion and compromise are
the foundation for a successful team. Our robots are to be student designed and
student built.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-what-to-and-not-to-bring-physically-and-mentally-what-to-expect">What we do. What to and not to bring (physically and mentally). What to expect.</h2>
<p>The Vail Academy and High School (VAHS) FTC teams, Tech Cat Robotics and Gear
Hounds, are participants in the annual competitions established by <em>FIRST</em>. We
are a team-oriented environment. We welcome all who are enthusiastic, curious
and hard working.</p>
<p>A common misconception about being on the robotics team is that you are only
involved in the robot build. Many other aspects of the team exist and have
heavy requirements; business, engineering notebook elements, outreach, and
spirit are a few examples. We work in a sub-team environment, but will be
expected to participate in an "all hands on deck" as gaps are determined in
team needs. All sub-teams will learn in a hands-on environment.</p>
<h3 id="robot-design">Robot Design</h3>
<p>Our philosophy is that our robot is student designed and student built. They
must meet all rules set forth by <em>FIRST</em> which are modified every year. Mentors
are there to guide and review issues, but it is ultimately the students’
decision and hard-work. For better or worse, this will truly be a student
designed and built robot. No exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>The Team Calendar is from August to March of the following year. We expect
members to take part in all events. While we strive to have a regular build
schedule, many issues can change this schedule.</p>
<p>Pre-competition meetings are necessary because training is accomplished then.
Familiarity with the parts, tools, and software used will be established.
Meetings are currently scheduled as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fridays 3:30 pm - 5:00 pm</li>
<li>Saturday 8:00 am - 12:00 pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendance at team practices are crucial. Just like a soccer or basketball
team, we practice and are innovative by relying on our teammates to bring
"game". Missing team practices may result in not being considered as a Driver
or Driver coach during competitions. Consistent absences may result in being
asked to leave the team.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-at-practices">Expectations at Practices</h2>
<p><em><strong>It is your responsibility to come prepared for practice.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete outside team requirements.</li>
<li>Don’t just jump in, if you arrive late – see what the team and sub-teams are
  working on and how you should fit in</li>
<li>Closed toed/heeled shoes and safety glasses are required for every practice.</li>
<li>Understand the safety requirements</li>
<li>Enthusiasm and a positive attitude.</li>
<li>Come prepared to pitch in and work hard.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to have your area cleaned and prepared to leave by
  practice end time.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to begin to wrapup 30 mins prior to leaving as this
  will enable us to have a debrief if necessary</li>
<li>Pick up all snack trash in your area.</li>
<li>Shut down and return computers to their backpacks or shelf.</li>
<li>Return all notebooks and reference material to their appropriate place.</li>
<li>Put away safety glasses.</li>
<li>Put away tools</li>
<li>Put away robot electronics and communication devices.</li>
<li>Check with team lead, mentors, and Coach to see if there is anything else,
  prior to leaving. If the above is not complete, do not ask Coach if you may
  leave.</li>
<li>Help move equipment to vehicles if necessary to pack up van for an upcoming
  competition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
<h3 id="students">Students</h3>
<h4 id="expectations">Expectations</h4>
<p>Students will put priority on their grades over any team's needs. Grades are
important.  Students must complete schoolwork before participating in teamwork
sessions and activities.  Read and understand all the rules of the competition.
Understand our team’s robot and competition strategy.</p>
<p>Ask for help! If you do not know what is going on or are unsure how to
accomplish a task assigned to you, ask for help or clarification.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, students are required to help clean up. If a student
needs to leave early they should clean up their own area and verify with a team
lead mentor or Coach before leaving.  Students may NOT wander the school and
should not leave without notifying Coach.</p>
<p>Team members are expected to put away cell phones and netbooks during work
sessions.  Students caught playing video games, randomly surfing the internet,
or any other non contributory actions will forfeit consideration for qualifying
events.</p>
<p>Understand that since VAHS hosts the team, we are subject to the rules in the
VAHS Handbook.  This includes behavior and dress code. While our team’s dress
code does emulate that of VAHS, it is not to the letter, but following the
team’s rules should keep us all out of the limelight with VAHS.</p>
<h4 id="respect">Respect</h4>
<p>Team members are expected to show Gracious Professionalism to everyone. Team
members are there to have a good experience, and deserve to have that good
experience. Members are to respect fellow team members, and themselves.</p>
<p>Not listening to adults on the team when they are trying to relay information
or training is disrespectful. They are there to give knowledge, assistance, and
training. They are volunteers, and are not being paid to be there helping you.
Remember that, and acknowledge that when dealing with them.</p>
<p>Team members are required to pay attention to the leadership, either adult or
student, while information is being disseminated. This applies to the update
session when the CROs are providing information, or when team leads are
performing training.</p>
<p>Students who are disrespectful and/or disruptive may be dismissed from the team
by the Team Coach.</p>
<h4 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h4>
<p>Success is an important part of FIRST and the team. It is not restricted to the
robot, game performance, or how many trophies the team is awarded. Team members
are successful when they succeed in the classroom, and then participate in team
activities. All team members are expected to make schoolwork and individual
academic performance a priority over any team event or activity.</p>
<p>Any student member of the team that is struggling with schoolwork can seek
help. The team will have resources available to help students with schoolwork.
You do not need to be ineligible or on probation to seek/receive help – just
ask!</p>
<h4 id="ftc-rules-regulations">FTC Rules &amp; Regulations</h4>
<p>All team members are responsible for knowing and understanding the Competition
manual for the season, which is released during Kick-off. Updates come at least
weekly, which include changes to the rules of the competition. These changes
can affect the design of the robot overall, or just a subsystem. The updates
may have an effect on gameplay, strategy, or a myriad of things.</p>
<p>Having all team members able to participate in understanding the total impact
of the updates is beneficial to the team, as some members may think of issues
others did not.</p>
<h4 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p>Conflicts will be resolved civilly and at the lowest portion of the chain.
Preferably, they will be resolved within the sub-team. If that is not a
possibility, then they will be resolved at the CRO level. If that does not
happen, then the issue will be brought before the mentors for resolution.</p>
<p>We understand there are times when an individual may not be comfortable
bringing issues up directly with the person they are having issues with, and
therefore may need to bring it directly to the CROs, or even the mentors. This
is acceptable, but not preferable.</p>
<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>Students are expected to check their listed email account, the team forum,
Facebook, etc. to stay current on what is happening. Team communications go out
in several formats, and it is the team member’s responsibility to stay informed
by checking the various sources.</p>
<p>If you cannot remember to check an email account or seek information, it is not
the team’s fault if you miss an event.</p>
<h3 id="team-coach">Team Coach</h3>
<p>The Team Coach is there to oversee all aspects of the team, and as such, is a
busy individual.  They are the liaison between the team and the administrators
of FIRST and the sponsors and the school administrations. They participate in
the meetings, but are also called off to other meetings the team leadership
and/or mentors may not be involved in.</p>
<p>The Team Coach acts as the presiding chair over the Mentor Council. Their goal
is always the betterment of the team.</p>
<h3 id="mentors-adult-members">Mentors, Adult Members</h3>
<p>Helping the students reach their full potential is the primary reason for
participating in FIRST.  We know that mentors have families, jobs, and other
important commitments outside of the team. We ask that mentors properly inform
us up front of how much time they think they will be able to contribute. Adult
chaperones on team outings are not allowed to consume alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>When dealing with the students, please remember that you are there to guide,
not to do. Also remember that these students do not have your life experiences,
and may not know all you do about a particular field. Take the time to get to
know the students and their abilities/limitations.  Respect them as well when
dealing with them. We also expect adult members to follow all the guidelines
stated in this handbook.</p>
<h3 id="parents">Parents</h3>
<p>Yes, we even have a section in here for you. It is imperative that the team
members have your full support. It is important that the team mentors have your
support, as well. For those members that cannot drive yet on their own, please
help make sure they are able to make as many meetings as possible.</p>
<p>The team needs your support in the terms of snacks being delivered during the
season. The team will send a link to a sign-up sheet. It is greatly appreciated
to have this sign-up sheet filled as soon as possible upon season starting.</p>
<h3 id="postitional">Postitional:</h3>
<h4 id="sub-team-leads">Sub-Team Leads</h4>
<p>Team Leads are responsible for the progression of their individual subteams,
and the coordination between the CROs and the subteams. This means that they
are responsible for the training of their subteam members. They are responsible
for meeting schedule, or keeping the Coach appraised of difficulties being
encountered with the schedule.</p>
<h4 id="chief-resiliency-officers-cros">Chief Resiliency Officers (CROs)</h4>
<p>CROs are responsible for insuring that the members follow safety rules, and to
remind individuals who have forgotten. This includes making sure that the
proper personal protective equipment is worn in the build room, or when
performing tasks inside or outside of the build room. The CRO is responsible
for insuring resiliency of teammates by monitoring stress levels and
maintaining as much as possible, an engaged practice. CROs are responsible for
