FTC challenges teams of young people to solve a robotics challenge in a game competition format. Starting with a \"kit of parts\" and a common set of rules, teams build robots and enter them in competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, a committee of engineers and other professionals. Teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.</p> <p>Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.</p> <p>FIRST redefines winning for these students because they are rewarded for excellence in design, demonstrated team spirit, gracious professionalism, maturity, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Scoring the most points is a secondary goal. Winning means building partnerships that last.</p> <p>We are proud of our ability to work as a team. Each team member should strive to apply this philosophy to his/her every action as a Tech Cat or a Gear Hound. The winners of FIRST competitions are teams, not individuals. Being a team means not fighting over who is right or wrong. Discussion and compromise are the foundation for a successful team. Our robots are to be student designed and student built.</p>"},{"location":"handbook/#what-we-do-what-to-and-not-to-bring-physically-and-mentally-what-to-expect","title":"What we do.
